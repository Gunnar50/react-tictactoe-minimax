## 🧠 Reflection

This project was a journey into the realm of AI in games, focusing specifically on the implementation of the Minimax algorithm in a React-based application. The challenge was not only in creating a functional Tic-Tac-Toe game but also in ensuring the AI was unbeatable, providing an excellent opportunity to deepen my understanding of AI strategies in game development.

The project posed a series of challenges including:

- Deep understanding of React funcitonal components
- Learning about game play and game development
- Minimax algorithm

### 🛠️ Technology Stack

- Visual Studio Code
- React Functional Components
- SASS
- Minimax Algorithm
